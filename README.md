# porfolyo-site

Portfolio site made with ChatGPT

The site is using the old react-dom version because it was made with ChatGPT. So it was done with ReactDOM.render. The router structure can be changed if desired. Images were taken with Midjourney, except programming language logos.

Lastly, the site is not responsive and optimized.

Start: npm run dev
